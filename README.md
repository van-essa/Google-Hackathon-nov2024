# **AI-Powered Employee Scheduling System**

#### **Description**
This repository contains the development of an AI-powered employee scheduling system leveraging **Gemini AI** and **Google OR-Tools**. The project addresses the challenges of time-consuming and inefficient manual scheduling processes faced by managers in industries like manufacturing, retail, and hospitality. 

#### **Problem Statement**
Managers often struggle to create schedules that balance employee satisfaction and operational efficiency. The schedules frequently:
- Fail to account for essential employee preferences and constraints.
- Misalign with fluctuating business demands.
- Result in decreased productivity and employee dissatisfaction.

#### **Solution**
This AI-driven scheduling system aims to:
- Automatically generate optimized schedules that maximize operational efficiency while respecting employee needs.
- Reduce the time managers spend on scheduling tasks.
- Enhance employee satisfaction by incorporating flexibility and fairness into the process.

#### **Target Audience**
This system is designed for industries that rely heavily on effective workforce management:
- **Manufacturing**
- **Retail**
- **Hospitality**

#### **Technologies Used**
- **Gemini AI**: For predictive insights and employee satisfaction modeling.
- **Google OR-Tools**: For solving complex optimization problems to generate the best schedules.
- **Python**: As the core programming language.

#### **Project Goals**
1. Integrate predictive analytics to forecast workforce demands.
2. Implement optimization algorithms to align employee preferences with business goals.
3. Deliver an intuitive interface for managers to review and adjust schedules.

#### **Features Used for Prediction**
The model uses various features (input data) to make this prediction. In your case, the features might include:

- **Sick History:** How many sick days the employee has taken in the past (this could indicate whether they are likely to be sick again).
- **Seasonality:** Whether it is the flu season or a period of high illness (e.g., winter months like December and January).
- **Shift Info:** The type of work shift (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, or Night) the employee is scheduled for. Shifts may influence an employeeâ€™s risk of becoming ill (e.g., night shifts might be more stressful or cause more fatigue).
- **Location:** The geographical location where the employee works (which could have a seasonal flu outbreak).
- **Skill:** The type of work the employee does, which could be linked to stress or health risks.
- **Labor Compliance:** Whether the employee is compliant with labor laws (e.g., rest periods, working hours), which might influence health outcomes.

**How the Model Predicts:**
Given a set of these features for an employee on a specific day (like in your new_data example), the model will output a prediction of whether the employee is likely to be sick (1) or available (0).

For example, if you provide the model with the following data:

`new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Sick_History': [0.2],  # Past sick history (normalized)
    'Seasonality': [0],  # Off-peak season
    'Shift_Info_Afternoon': [0],  # Afternoon shift
    'Shift_Info_Night': [1],  # Night shift
    'Location_South': [1],  # Employee works in the South region
    'Skill_Maintenance': [0],  # Employee works in another skill category
    'Labor_Compliance': [1],  # Compliant with labor laws
})`

The model will look at these features and predict whether this employee is likely to be sick or available.
- **Output: **Prediction for new data: [1] means that the model predicts this employee is likely to be sick (1) on this day.
